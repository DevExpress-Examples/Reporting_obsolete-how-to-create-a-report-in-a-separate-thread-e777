# How to create a report in a separate thread

By default, the [WinForms Document Viewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.Preview.DocumentViewer) creates document pages in the `Application.Idle` event. Users may access document pages as soon as pages are ready. The progress bar down below the viewer indicates a document generation progress. Users can stop document generation if required.

You may wish to enable the [DocumentViewer.UseAsyncDocumentCreation](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.Control.PrintControl.UseAsyncDocumentCreation) option and enhance user experience while previewing, exporting, and printing reports. For more information, refer to the following article: [How to create a report in a separate thread](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/a2359/how-to-create-a-report-in-a-separate-thread).
